# brickBreaker

Brick breaker game built with pure oop javascript.

It has few levels, the levels are stored in a separated JS file.

The game has lives and score. Not all bricks have the same score.

If all lives are spent (the ball falls), then you get a "Game Over".

If the level is passed successfully, then you will move to the next level.

If all levels are passed successfully, then you will get a "You Won" message :).
